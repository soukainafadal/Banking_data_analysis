# Banking_data_analysis
During the work, the task of preliminary analysis of a positive response (term deposit) to direct calls from a bank is solved. In essence, the task is a matter of bank scoring, i.e. according to the characteristics of a client (potential client), their behavior is predicted (loan default, a wish to make a deposit, etc.).

In this project, we will try to give answers to a set of questions that may be relevant when analyzing banking data:

1- What is the share of clients attracted in our source data? <br>
2- What are the mean values​ of numerical features among the attracted clients? <br>
3- What are the mean values ​​of numerical features among the attracted clients? <br>
4- What is the average call duration for the attracted clients? <br>
5- What is the average age among the attracted and unmarried clients? <br>
6- What is the average age and call duration for different types of client employment?
